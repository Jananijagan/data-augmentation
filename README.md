# data-augmentation
Data augmentation is a technique used in deep learning and machine learning to artificially increase the size of a training dataset by making small changes to the original data. This technique can help improve the generalization and robustness of the trained models. 
 
Here are some benefits of data augmentation: 
 
Reduces overfitting: Data augmentation can help reduce overfitting by training models on slightly modified copies of existing data. 
 
Improves model robustness: Data augmentation can help improve the robustness of models. 
 
Corrects imbalanced datasets: Data augmentation can help correct imbalanced datasets. 
 
Increases dataset size and variability: Data augmentation can help increase the size and variability of a dataset. 
 
Some examples of data augmentation techniques include: 
 
Flipping: An image can be flipped horizontally to produce a mirror image or flipped vertically to produce an image that is upside down. 
 
Changing the color space: The color space of an image can be changed, for example from RGB to grayscale. 
 
Applying deformations: Deformations can be applied to an image to simulate tissue distortions in medical images. 
 
Removing patches: Square or rectangular patches can be removed from images to encourage the model to learn from other parts of the image. 
 
Combining images: Two or more images and their labels can be combined to create new samples. 
 
Scaling features: Features can be scaled to a common range for consistent model training.
